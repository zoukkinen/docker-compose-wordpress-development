= 9.4.0 =
Release Date: January 8th, 2019

Content analysis recalibration (beta):

* Adds a toggle feature for subscribing to the recalibration beta under SEO -> General -> Features.
* When the recalibration feature is enabled:
  * The single title assessment is added. This assessment makes sure that you don't use superfluous H1s in your text.
  * Assessments changes:
    * Keyphrase density: changes scoring schema to account for the length of the keyphrase and changes feedback strings so that we give feedback about the number of occurrences rather than a percentage.
    * Outbound links assessment: changes the scoring schema so that red bullet instead of an orange bullet is shown when you have no outbound links.
    * Image alt attributes: if there are at least 5 images, checks whether the alt tags contain the keyphrase or synoynyms in 30-70% of all images. If there are less than 5 images, 1 image with the keyphrase or synonym in the alt tag is still scored as good.
    * Keyphrase in title: function words preceding the exact match keyphrase are ignored when determining the position of the keyphrase in the title.
    * Keyphrase length: makes the scoring scheme less strict for languages that don't have function word support, so that for these languages keyphrases with 1-6 words are scored as green, 7-9 as orange, and more than 9 as red.
    * Keyphrase in subheading: only takes H2 and H3 level subheadings into account and changes the scoring schema so that 30%-75% of these subheadings need to include the keyphrase or its synonyms. In languages without function word support, a match is only counted if all the words from the keyphrase/synonym appear in the subheading.
    * Text length: on taxonomy pages, the recommended minimum text length is increased from 150 to 250 words.
  * Assessment removals:
    * The assessment checking the length or your URL.
    * The assessment checking whether your URL contains stopwords.

Enhancements:

* Improve accessibility of the analysis results.
* Improve accessibility of the Title Separator setting.
* Adds a new filter for adjacent-rel links: `wpseo_adjacent_rel_url`.

Bugfixes:

* Fixes a bug where special characters from certain word lists weren't correctly escaped when matched with a regex. This resulted in `eggs` being incorrectly matched as the transition word `e.g.`, for example.
* Fixes a bug where the search appearance setting for a custom content type named `profile` would have a broken layout.
* Fixes a bug where pagination elements were not shown in the Genesis theme.

Other:

* Uses method `is_simple_page` instead of `is_singular` in method robots. Props to: [stodorovic](https://github.com/stodorovic)
* Adds method `is_woocommerce_active` and check is woocommerce activate before registering hooks. Props to [stodorovic](https://github.com/stodorovic)
* Adds static variables to "cache" results of functions [`is_shop`](https://docs.woocommerce.com/wc-apidocs/function-is_shop.html) and [`wc_get_page_id`](https://docs.woocommerce.com/wc-apidocs/function-wc_get_page_id.html). Props to [stodorovic](https://github.com/stodorovic)
* Verifies that variable `post` is an instance of `WP_Post` in `WPSEO_Admin_Bar_Menu ::get_singular_post()`. Props to [@yingles](https://github.com/yingles).
* Improves strings to be more easily translated. Props to [pedro-mendonca](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca)
* The browser console now shows more descriptive error messages when something went wrong during analyses in the web worker.
